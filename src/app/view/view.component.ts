Director Ryan Coogler made sure that this fictional East African country came to life on the big screen.</p><p>Wakanda, which was hidden from the outside world for centuries, depicts a civilization that remains free from colonialism&rsquo;s ravaging grasp, where gender roles are transcended, technological advances abound, and natural resources are not pillaged. Wakanda&rsquo;s beauty and development appear to have facilitated an atmosphere where its people can thrive, learn, and explore bold, new possibilities.</p><p>So,&nbsp;how can we #Wakandaforever and make Wakanda our reality? There are many companies helping to facilitate an atmosphere where our community thrives in areas of technology, social justice, financial literacy, education, and group economics. The companies below&nbsp;have made it their mission to promote innovative change and help advance the community:</p><p><strong><u>Technology</u>:&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><a href=\"http://spokehub.co/\">SpokeHub</a></p><p>SpokeHub launched in June 2017. This Durham-based black-owned tech company has grown exponentially since June. The platform allows users or &lsquo;hubsters&rsquo; to weigh in on a myriad of topics with other individuals;&nbsp;&ldquo;it&rsquo;s a place to talk about your passions, hear other perspectives, and find new topics that interest you.&rdquo; For example, one &lsquo;hub&rsquo; topic might be about &lsquo;Black Panther&rsquo; while a completely different hub conversation could be about politics. When speaking to one of the five co-founders, Richard Berryman, he also made clear that SpokeHub provides a functionality called augmented reality (&quot;AR&quot;)&nbsp;- an innovative technology that allows for a video or 3D experience to be viewed on a user&#39;s phone by simply scanning a trigger image (such as a logo or design). This will eventually enhance how we as consumers purchase products, how we learn new concepts, and how we engage in social media.&nbsp;The possibilities are endless for SpokeHub.</p><p><strong><u>Group Economics</u></strong>:<a href=\"https://webuyblack.com/\">&nbsp; WeBuyBlack</a></p><p>WeBuyBlack is a black-owned company created by Shareef Abdul-Malik.&nbsp;WeBuyBlack is an online marketplace, which hosts the largest platform&nbsp;for Black entrepreneurs&nbsp;to display their products for sale.
